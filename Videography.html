<h3> The Project Purpose</h3>
<p> The purpose of this project was to learn how to use camera gear such as video cameras and tripods and to learn how to use video editing softwares. 

  <h3> Planning </h3>
  <p> In order to plan for this project my group went through a series of organization and storyboarding. We first created a script that was completed by Brekken and then created a breakdown of every scence. This storyboard breakdown consisted of a drawing of each scene, a descriptipn of what the shot would look like, the duration of the scene, and where we wanted the scene location to be. From there we were able to begin our video shooting process. In order to pick our topic Meg spoke to some of her bioology professors about prominent areas around campus that may be lesser known to other students. </p>

  <h3> My Groups Video (MU Orcahrds) </h3>
  <p> The topic that we chose for our video was the MU Orchards. The orchards are a small plot of trees on the edge of campus that will one day grow into a variety of fruit trees, these fruit trees will be open to the students of Millersville and the Millersville community to come and have access to food. We began our filming process by collecting a variety of overhead drone footage of the orchard. From there we shot a few scenes in front of the fenced off area and then a few scenes by the trees at caputo hall. We felt that these areas were relavent because they had good lighting, showed off the topic, and showed off the department that sponsered and planted the area. After shooting we edited the video using Adobe Lightroom. Over all the video was about 70 seconds long which was within the time limit and went well, however a voice over could have resolved a few of our audio issues.
