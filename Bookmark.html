  <h3>The Project Purpose</h3>
  <p> The purpose of this project was to design, print, and finish a custom bookmark for Pequea Elementary School Library through learning about different print process, mainly lithography.</p>

  <h3> Research </h3>
  <p> This project in specific did not require a lot of research as it is a more creative endeavor. During the brainstorming and creation process I did need to search for images that were suitable for the bookmark design and that were free to use for personal and educational use. I found images that met these requirements on Freepik.com, most of the images on this website are free to use however it may ask you to give the website accreditation somewhere on the project the images are being used for when you read the terms and conditions. I also decided I wanted to use a more interesting font so I found a font that was free to use for peronal and educational purposes through DaFont.com.</p>

  <h3> My Bookmark Design </h3>
  <p> For my bookmark design I made variety of drafts that mainly focused on fantasy and things that would interest young kids, after some consideration I decided on outerspace and astronauts, and aliens as my theme. I wanted my bookmark to be fun and also interactive for the kids who recieve the bookmark to keep the kids interested in reading, in order to do this I tried to leave every image possible as just line art so that it can be colored in like a coloring book page. I decided to keep the space theme going with the text on my bookmark and decided on the phrase "Explore New Worlds With A Good Book!". To actaully create my book mark design I primarily used two softwares, these were Adobe Illustrator and Adobe InDesign. I used Illustrator to seperate some of my images and to remove some of the backgrounds and I used InDesign to format my text and images.</p>
 
<h3> The Printing Process </h3>
<p> The process of actually creating the printed copies of my book mark design consisted mainly of utilizing a lithography printer and a shear. The first step that was taken was creating a print plate in our other print lab, after the craetion of the plate we were able to begin work in the lithography print lab. In the lab we learned how to fix the plate to the printing press and how to pre dampen the plate. After that we closed the saftey cages and switched on the press, from there I learned the order to use the various buttons and levers on the machine. With that knowledge the copies came shooting out from the machine into the catch tray. After all 75 copies were made we put the pages into the shear to create clean and even cuts to the bookmarks, this was the final step before they were reay to be shipped off to Pequea Elementry School. </p>
